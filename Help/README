			Gamma
			Set the on-screen gamma correction
			by Thomas Leonard

BRIEF

Gamma is a simple program to set the on-screen gamma correction (using
the xgamma command, installed with XFree86). You do not need to compile it
before using it, but you will require ROX-Lib2:

To run, click on Gamma's icon in a filer window. You can either set the Red,
Green and Blue corrections separately, or all at once.
